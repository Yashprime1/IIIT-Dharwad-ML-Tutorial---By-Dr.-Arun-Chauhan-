# Brief Summary :

## Task :

1. Draw 10 sample from Gaussian distribution of mean =5 and variance = 1
2. Draw likelihood function for mean between 0 to 10. (Keep var = 1 constant)

## How I implemented it in short :

1) I wrote a gausian function ( also np.norm could've done the work :) ) 
2) I then took  10 x values (0-10) , got some 10 y values
3) Then keeping the points constant , I found  out different curves by changing values of mean
4) Then plotted the Likelihood curves also finally plotted a Likelihood v/s Mean plot

## Output :
