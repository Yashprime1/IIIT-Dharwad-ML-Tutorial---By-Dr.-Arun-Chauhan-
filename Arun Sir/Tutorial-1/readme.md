# Brief Summary :

## Task :

For a given dataset: (1,1.2), (2,1.9), (3,3.2)
Find the line which fits the data using maximum likelihood function. Plot the line with the given dataset and also take value of beta=1

## How I implemented it in short :

1) Differentiated the likelihood function , found out gradient inn terms of w  (since the only parameters that could change was w , rest all were constant)
2) Then equated the gradient = 0 ( close-form solution also could've applied gradient descent)
3) Solved for w0 and w1 (since it was given that we had to fit  a line)
4) Then plotted the points and the line as given below

## Output :
