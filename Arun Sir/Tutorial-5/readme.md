# Brief Summary :

## Task :

Code the Kernel Regression in Python and share this to me as Colab notebook.
Dataset: Take 10 points (x_i) from the uniform distribution from 0 to 1.
then y_i = Sin(2*pi*x_i) + random noise.
Random noise can be draw from normal standard distribution.

PS: You need to approximately reproduce the same figure 6.3 from PRML.

## How I implemented it in short :

1) Here , first I wrote the functions to generate test points and train points
2) Then wrote the function for kernel regression using Nadaraya Watson model for kernel linear regression
3) A supporting kernel function implemented later (as per Nadayara Watson model
4) Then I plotted the curves for True function , Predicted function and also the variations from that predicted function
